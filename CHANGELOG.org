* Changes (2026-02-01)
Performance: Added an early-init.el file (inspired by Doom Emacs) and aggressive lazy-loading for significant speed gains.
Workflow: Remove init.el from git, it's now auto-generated from init.org. No need to version control two files.
Documentation: Much better docs. More in depth, like in kickstart.nvim.
Refactors: The codebase is now much more modular and easier to hack on.
Tree-sitter: Included a guide/example on writing your own custom font-locking rules.

New packages:
- Emacs Async: Much faster package installation.
- Mason.el: Package manager for LSP, DAP, linters.
- Embark: Right click like menu in Emacs.
- Hl-todo: Highlight todo keywords.
- Indent-guide: Show indentation.

New Optional packages:
 - Undo setup: Undo Fu, Undo-fu-session, Vundo.
 - Snippy: VSCode/LSP snippet support for Emacs with Yasnippet.
 - Jinx: Enchanted Spell Checker
 - Esup: Emacs Start Up Profiler.

and much more.

Enjoy!
